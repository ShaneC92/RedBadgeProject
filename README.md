Ur-A-Critic

## Description
This is a Red Badge Project that was built during the last few weeks of Web Development Bootcamp. As a team we created a full CRUD app that allows users to signup, login and browse a list of featured movies and a list of weekly recommendations by the Admin, with the ability to add to favorites, delete from favorites, add a comment, edit a comment, and delete a comment. In the admin view, the Admin is able to login and add movies to the recommended weekly movie list, delete a movie from the list, see a list of active members(users), update a members name, and delete a member. This project utilizes The Movie Database to fetch movies from their API. https://www.themoviedb.org/

## Build
VSCode
The application utilizes PostgreSQL and NodeJS ORM library (Sequelize) to persist data to the database.
